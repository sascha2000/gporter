# GPORTER GP-102
Setting and reading POIs on a GPORTER GP-102 GPS device for geocaching or other purposes.

## Intention
I bought GPORTER GP-102 device for geocaching. Sadly the included windows software does not allow to set POIs. So the device became pretty useless for geocaching. 
I wrote a simple command line application, that directly can set POIs and read them. So geocaching or google maps coordinates in decimal format can be taken.  


## Compile
gcc gporter.c -ogporter

## Install
sudo cp gporter /usr/bin/

## The POI format
You'll find a simple description in "POI-Format.ods".

## Usage
On my linux machine when the GPORTER GP-102 is connected it will appear in "/media/"username"/CANMORE/GP-102". The place will be different on your machine.

### Setting a POI
I have choosen the parking place of the television tower of Stuttgart. 

https://www.google.de/maps/place/Fernsehturm+Stuttgart/@48.7553172,9.1886679,36m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x4799c4a78c941ea5:0xee74d8b131b9a572!8m2!3d48.755857!4d9.1901086

Google says it is on:
48.755319, 9.188723

This means N48.755319, E9.188723. 

To set this POI change in the POI directory enter in a shell (bash) "cd /media/username/CANMORE/GP-102/POIs". Enter the following to set the POI 010: 

gporter  -N48.755319 -E9.188723 -o010

If you want to set a symbol, other than the star you can chosse between star, house,  flag, car, eat, bus, gas, skyscraper, plane. 

To set a house symbol on the same coordinate use the -s parameter and enter: 

gporter  -N48.755319 -E9.188723 -o010 -shouse

### Setting a POI with date
The gporter shows in its display POIS in the format xxxx-xxxx. You can set those eight digits by using the -d and -t parameter. If you want to set 5678-1234 enter:

gporter  -N48.755319 -E9.188723 -o010 -shouse -d5678 -t1234

### Reading a POI
To read a coordinate enter enter in a shell (bash) "cd /media/username/CANMORE/GP-102/POIs. Type:

gporter -r 001

This may output a coordinate like:

N48.712320 E9.306870

Enter this one in google maps to see where it is.

## Test-coordinates 
In the folder gporter_files you'll find some test coordinates.
